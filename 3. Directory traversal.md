This web vulnerability allows the attacker to read sensitive files on the server that is running an application. This includes sensitive OS files, credentials for back-end systems, programs, etc. An attacker might even be able to write arbitrary files that will modify application data and behaviour. 

### 1.simple case
https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-simple

For this lab, I had to change some Burpsuite options in the response interception rules section:
![[Pasted image 20230301110600.png]]

I need to forward on the proxy multiple times, as the first time only shows the productID:
![[Pasted image 20230301110813.png]]

I finally got what I wanted after several forwards:
![[Pasted image 20230301110850.png]]
Then simply write in the vulnerable site:
```
../../../etc/passwd
```
then send to repeater.

The passwd will show in the pretty section, it will not render. The lab is finished

Dot dot slash means stepping up a level in the directory, and 3 of these will get me to the root directory ( / ). I am assuming that the image is stored in /var/www/images .

../ and ..\ are both valid for windows. A similar attack to retreive standard OS files would be:
```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini
```

### 2. sequences blocked with absolute path bypass
https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-absolute-path-bypass

This lab is identical to the previous one except that directory traversal sequences are stripped/blocked. But a cheapway to bypass this is to simply use the *absolute* file path i.e. /etc/passwd

The results look like this:

### 3.sequences stripped non-recursively
https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-sequences-stripped-non-recursively

There are nested path traversal sequences such as ....// and ....\/ that will revert to simple traversal sequences if the inner sequence is stripped. 

In this case it was simply using:
```
=....//....//....//etc/passwd
```
### 4. sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode
https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-superfluous-url-decode

It is known the URL encoding can bypass santization that strips directory traversal sequences when the parameter is multipart. In this lab a certain style of URL encoding worked, but there are many other combinations that could possibly work. 

For whatever reason '.' can't be encoded properly on burpsuite, it didn't evene work on a seperate encode/decode website. The encoded form of '.' is: 
	%2e
Its double encoded form is:
	%252e

The lab also mentions "alternate" encoding formats such as:
	..%c0%af
	.%ef%bc%8f
(I don't know what they are)

In this lab, the sequence that worked is:
```
..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd
```
The dots weren't encoded, the slashes were double encoded with the last one remaining normal. (I don't know why they left the last one). 

### 5. file path traversal; validation of start of path
https://0af500d5046d7951c4d77a5c00d30091.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=3

Sometimes the server requires the same base file path i.e. /var/www/images 
This can be easily worked around by just attaching everything else.
```
/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```

### 6. validation of file extension with null byte bypass 
https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-validate-file-extension-null-byte-bypass

I don't know what null byte bypass is. 

If the application demands the user-supplied filename to be in e.g. .png format, I can use a null byte to terminate the file path.
