It's just like SSRF, in the sense that vulnerable applications running on the server can be exploited when priviledge is faked. 

This time a user/victim is needed to click on your constructed website, which will then send a HTTP request to the vulnerable server. If the user happens to logged in, the session cookie will be automatically included in the request (thus I impersonate the user kinda). The website will process the request as if it was made by the victim user. 

I don't really know any of this works in detail, e.g. the HTTP requests, the HTML.
