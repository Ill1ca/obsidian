## 1. Logic flow overriding with SQL injection:

The website had items in different categories:
![[Pasted image 20221222224839.png]]

This triggers the GET request from the SQL database.

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

The lab demands me to show products from all categories, both released and unreleased, they used a binary variable for release status (i.e. 0 means unreleased.)

Using Burp Suite, I press forward a couple times and then ctrl + R to send to the repeater. 
![[Pasted image 20221222225343.png]]
Anything after the equals sign behind category is able to be messed with. The plus symbols represent spaces (GET request syntax). 

By using: 
```
'+or+1=1+--+- 
``` 
The first apostrophe breaks out of the input field originally from "corporate gifts". The first plus symbol is actually not necessary given the the apostrophe is filled in. Having OR 1=1 completely neutralizes the result of "caterogory = corporate gifts" and instead shows me all the category. the second section comments out rest of the code, therefore both unreleased and released products are shown. 

SIDE NOTE: You might need to use stuff like ')" if the machine uses subqueries.



## 3. Examining the database
https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database
## 4. Union injection
https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks

The union keyword allows you to combine one or more SELECT queries and will return appended results to the original query. for example:
```
SELECT a, b from TABLE1 UNION SELECT c, d from TABLE2
```
In this case, the query will return a single result set in two columns. One for table1 containing a and b values and one for table2 containing c and d values. 

TWO KEY REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET FOR UNION TO WORK:
1. Individual queries must return the same number of columns
2. datatypes in between columns must be compatible between queries

To ensure these requirements are met for a UNION attack, you must determine:
1. how many columns are returned from the *original* query?
2. which columns from the original query has suitable datatypes to hold the results of the iniected query?

### 1. How many columns are returned from the *original* query?

There are **2** ways:
I. By using ORDER BY
```
' order by 1-- -
' order by 2-- -
' order by 3-- -
```
This works by using "order by" and increments the specified index number until an error occurs. These queries will order the results by different columns by their index. The key is that you don't even need to know the name of any columns. Eventually the specified column index exceeds the *actual* number, the databse will return an error.  

For example, if I did it up to 5 and doing so got me an error, than the database must has 5 - 1 = 4 columns. 

The error will not manifest itself in proper SQL form (because this would imply that all SQL queries are shown the results and that's stupid web design), but some noticeable difference will be seen e.g. database error in HTTP response, generic error or no results. 

II.  By using UNION SELECT
```
' union select NULL--
' union select NULL,NULL--
' union select NULL,NULL,NULL--
```
Recall that union will only work properly if (1) "individual queries must return the same number of columns". This method increments until error in the same way as the previous method. If I can do this up to three null values and fail on the fourth, that would mean the original query has 3 columns. 

An extra row may be seen on the HTML table, or a NullPointerException error is triggered. There is a chance that the response may be indistinguishable from a regular query. 

https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns

Here is the interface that I'm working with:
![[Pasted image 20230214111615.png]]

At this point I open Burpsuite and press on a random category, then send it to the repeater.

![[Pasted image 20230214111955.png]]
(entry point for SQLi is circled)

To test for SQLi vulnerability, I type:
```
'--
```
And in this case the website showed blankness, this proves that commenting out the rest and closing the parenthesis worked.

Now to determine the number of columns using method 1:
```
category=Gifts' UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL--
```
(with URL encoding) 

At this point I was trying to redo the lab but I'm getting timeout errors, there will be no screenshots.

Method 2:
```
category=Gifts' UNION order by 4--
```
### 2. Which columns from the original query has suitable datatypes


 This is a straight forward process, given that I will already know the number of columns returned in the original query, I simply have to probe each column with a string or integer to test for an error and fill the rest with null values.

For example if a query returned 4 columns:

```
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
```
An error like this will occur:
```
Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.
```

![[Pasted image 20230214115127.png]]

I'll be using the 'order by' method in this case, which reveals information that would otherwise be unknown if I used the 'select NULL' technique. 

To firstly find the number of columns returned in the query, I need to keep incrementally ordering the columns until an error occurs. 

![[Pasted image 20230214115955.png]]

Despite correctly doing everything, it is evident in the render that nothing has changed after ordering by column 1. You'd expect the products to be sorted by alphabetical order but this is not the case. The implication is that there is some sort of ID column (SQL convention) that is the real column 1, of which we cannot see that by default is presented to the website in *already* sorted form.

Thus, I'd expect 'order by 2' to sort the products alphabetically.
![[Pasted image 20230214120306.png]]
*As expected* 

'Order by 3' by the same logic should sort the products in ascending or descending prices.
![[Pasted image 20230214120442.png]]

And now ordering by 4:
![[Pasted image 20230214120513.png]]

It is confirmed that there are 3 columns, and I am instructed to retreive the string: 'GQORF1'.

Now it is time to do this: 
![[Pasted image 20230214120654.png]]

Looks like column 1 (the assumed ID column) isn't in string form.

![[Pasted image 20230214120804.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230214120852.png]]
*notice the "a"*

It seems that column 2 is in string form and a has been selected by the database. 

![[Pasted image 20230214121128.png]]
*I can keep the first "a" there, I know it won't break due to that one.* 

column 3 isn't in string form either, that should be obvious since it is the price (i.e. numbers) column. 

And now to finish it off:
```
Food+%26+Drink'+UNION+select+NULL,+'GQORF1',+NULL-- 
```

### 3. The union injection attack
Now all that is left is to use the injection method, however you are still required to know the names of the columns. You can guess the names of these columns to see if they follow normal database convention. 
```
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```
https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-retrieve-data-from-other-tables



Multiple values can be retrieved from the database by using string concatenation with a chosen seperator, e.g. '~' in this case:
```
' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
```
The double pipe sequence (||) is the string concatenation operator on oracle.
The output would look something like:
```
...
admin~s3cure
peter~pan
carlos~12345
```
