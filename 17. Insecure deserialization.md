This vulnerability involves backend web development programming languages with object-oriented programming capabilities including: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP. 

```ad-summary
**serialization**:
This is the process that breaks down complex coding structures, this case being objects, into a "flatter" format. Then this can be sent and received as a sequential byte stream to another host. Serialization simplifies:
- writing complex data to files, databases or inter-process memory 
- sending of data over networks, between compoments of an application, or in an API call

*An object's state (attributes) along with their assigned values are persisted during serialization.* 

**deserialization**:
This is the restoration of the byte stream into a functional replica of the objeect being sent over, so that it can be interacted like any other object within the website.

**insecure deserialization**
When user-controllable data is deserialized by a website, this allows an attacker to manipulate the serialized objects to pass harmful data into the application code.

It is even possible to swap the serialized object with another belonging to an entirely different class (available to that website). They will all be deserialized and instantiated without resistance. This is why insecure deserialization is also known as "*object injection*".

An object belonging to an unexpected class might cause an exception error, however the damage may have already been done. This is because the deserialization process itself can initiate an attack, and in many times the it is over before the entire process ends. Additionally, this vulnerability does not depend on the website's functionality to directly interact with the malicious object to work. 

### Identifying Insecure Deserialization

**PHP serialization format**
It is mostly human readable; letters represent datatype and numbers represent corresponding lengths of each entry. Consider a "User" object with the attributes: 
```PHP
$user->name = "carlos";
$user->isLoggedIn = true;
```
After serialization, the object will look like this: 
```PHP
O:4:"User":2:{s:4:"name":s:6:"carlos"; s:10:"isLoggedIn":b:1;}
```
Interpretation:
| section           | meaning                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| O:4:"User"        | an object with class name of length 4: User       |
| 2                 | the object has 2 attributes                       |
| s:4:"name"        | first attribute's key of length 4: "name"         |
| s:6:"carlos"      | The first attribute's value of length 6: "carlos" |
| s:10:"isLoggedIn" | Second attribute's key of length 10: "isLoggedIn" |
| b:1               | Second attribute's boolean value: true (1)        |

PHP has native methods *serialize()* and *unserialize()*. I should start looking for *unserialize()* in the source code to investigate possible vulnerabilities.

**Java**
Java uses binary serialization formats which are difficult to read, however the serialized data can be easily identified. For example, serialized java objects alaways begin in the same bytes, which are encoded as:
	ac ed (in hexadecimal)
	rO0 (in base64)
Classes that implement the interface: *java.io.Serializable* can be serialized and deserialized. The *readObject()* method is used to read and deserialize data from an InputStream, this should be a key indicator in the source code.

**Manipulating serialized objects**
There are two approaches to manipulating serialized objects. 
1. directly editing the object in its byte stream form
2. writing a short script in the corresponding language to create and serialize the new object
The latter is often easier when dealing with binary serialization formats since reading them is difficult.

### Modifying Serialized Objects

**Modifying object attributes**
An attacker only needs to preserve the validity of the object while tampering with its data. Then a server-side object to be deserialized and created with the modified attributes. 

Consider a simple case:
```ad-example
A website uses a serialized object User to store user session data in a cookie. The decoded object found in a HTTP request has the following byte stream:
~~~PHP
O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:6:"carlos";s:7:"isAdmin";b:0;}
~~~
The isAdmin attrribute is of interest, this boolean value can be changed to 1 (true), re-encoded and overwrite the current cookie. There will be no effect unless the website uses the cookie to check user privilege for administrative functionality:
~~~PHP
$user = unserialize($_COOKIE);
if ($user->isAdmin == true) {
// allow access to admin interface
}
~~~
This vulnerable code would instntiate the attacker-modified User object from the cookie, allowing for a massive attack surface exposed from easy privilege escalation. 
```

**Modifying serialized objects**: https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting/lab-deserialization-modifying-serialized-objects 

This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism. I am required to exploit this and gain admin privileges in order to delete the user *carlos*. I am given the user credentials:
	wiener:peter 

The initial POST request for entering the login details has no mention of a cookie yet. 
![[Pasted image 20230427110251.png]]

However after forwarding this, the next one is a GET request for /my-account and has a session argument. Send this to the repeater. 
![[Pasted image 20230427110434.png]]
The cookie seems to have a bit of URL-encoding in the very end:
![[Pasted image 20230427111547.png]]
This equals sign at the end of this string is an obvious indicator of base64 encryption. I go to cyberchef to decrypt this. 
![[Pasted image 20230427111824.png]]

Now I change the boolean attribute for "admin" to 1 for obvious reasons, then re-encrypt it back to base64 and then URL encode the equals sign at the end.
	Tzo0OiJVc2VyIjoyOntzOjg6InVzZXJuYW1lIjtzOjY6IndpZW5lciI7czo1OiJhZG1pbiI7YjowO30= 
	Tzo0OiJVc2VyIjoyOntzOjg6InVzZXJuYW1lIjtzOjY6IndpZW5lciI7czo1OiJhZG1pbiI7YjowO30%3d

This modified object alone won't do anything, I need to utilise it by navigating to /admin instead. I knew /admin existed because typing it in the URL gave me a page saying that I needed admin privilege to gain functionality. 
![[Pasted image 20230427112358.png]]

I get a 200 OK and the render shows this:
![[Pasted image 20230427113313.png]]

Now I search for carlos in the source code and delete the user my changing the GET request parameter to the target URL. Then follow the redirection to see the lab completing. 

**Modifying data types**
Unexpected data types can be easily supplied in PHP due to its loose comparison operator. 
```ad-example
~~~PHP
5 == "5" //true
5 == "5 is a number" //true
0 == "Example string" //true
~~~
```
One can see why the first example evaluates to true. The justification for the second example is that PHP will convert the entire string into an integer based on the initial number. The rest is ignored. 

Because the string in the third string has no numerals in it, PHP will treat the entire string as a 0. Consider the potential case:
```PHP
$login = unserialize($_COOKIE)
if ($login['password'] == $password) {
// log in successfully
}
```
If an attacker managed to replace the password attribute with the integer 0 instead, the condition will return **true** as long as the stored password does not start with a number. 

This is only possible because deserialization preserves data types, the 0 would have been converted to a string had the code fetched the password from the request directly. Thus the condition would have evaluated to false. 

**modifying serialized data types**: https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting/lab-deserialization-modifying-serialized-data-types

In this lab, I have to edit the serialized object in the session cookie to gain access to the **administrator** account and delete carlos. Once again I have the credentials wiener:peter
