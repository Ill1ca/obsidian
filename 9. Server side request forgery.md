Applications from the server side are exploited by the attacker to make requests, execute commands or connect to external locations. Sensitive data could be leaked, the internal server could be mettled with, and worst of all it could act as a foothold for a malicious onward attack. 

Common SSRF attacks exploit the trust relationships between a server and itself, or its own backend systems. 

### 1. Basic SSRF against local server
https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-localhost
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMxCQcktifs

In this lab, my objective is to access the admin interface and delete the user *carlos* via the vulnerable stock check URL. 
![[Pasted image 20230128205148.png]]

The stock check feature will be for any product, at this point I open Burp Suite and turn on Foxyproxy. Upon pressing view details on a product, I am automatically directed to Burp Suite:
![[Pasted image 20230128205347.png]]

I will forward the request as many times as needed to go to the URL, in this case just once. 

![[Pasted image 20230128205640.png]]

I press the check stock button and once again I'm redirected to Burp Suite. But this time instead of forwarding I will send to repeater (ctrl + R) and go there (ctrl + shift + R) to modify my payload. 

![[Pasted image 20230128211146.png]]
This is the target located at the bottom of the POST request. It can be URL decoded (ctrl + shift + U) which would look like:
![[Pasted image 20230128211258.png]]
If I tried to forward it with it being decoded and it would not work. 

The person in the YouTube video firstly tries if she can access the application itself, which would look something like this:
![[Pasted image 20230128211733.png]]
(note that the link is basically the original one but cut off after "net:8080/" and then URL encoded) 
In this case it didn't work without a parameter. 

Next up, I see if there an application running on localhost, and this time I will use the link http://localhost 
![[Pasted image 20230128212127.png]]


I know that this worked because the render shows an "admin panel" which is obviosuly not found as when you'r'e a user from the site. 

Here is where the trust relationship becomes a weakness. The application that is running on localhost i.e. locally on the server and it doesn't require me to log in to access the admin panel. This is because it assumes that if I have access to the server itself then I'm already considered authenticated. 

This is different compared to accessing from an external perspective i.e. the login page. 

Next I want to access the admin panel, and to find out its URL I will click on the raw (basically inspect element) and search for the admin panel.
![[Pasted image 20230128212859.png]]

Now I go there with the new link:
![[Pasted image 20230128212945.png]]

It is evident that the lab is coming to a close as the delete users function is the only thing on the panel, now I repeat the same process looking for the delete users function in the source code and aim directly for *carlos*.
![[Pasted image 20230128213306.png]]

The 302 foound indicates that the request passed through and I'm getting redirected to another page. The follow redirection button is to the right of the forward button. 

![[Pasted image 20230128213514.png]]
(401 unauthorized)
The reason I get unauthorized is because I'm trying to access the admin itnerface from an external perspective (before redirection).
![[Pasted image 20230128213724.png]]

In order to confirm that all of this worked, I need to go back into the admin page to check. 
![[Pasted image 20230128213835.png]]

Carlos is no longer in the users list, that is the end of the lab. 

### 2. Basic SSRF against another back-end system 
https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4Hrq7TCTPU

Once again I gotta delete carlos from admin panel. But I don't know what the exact IP is. I have to enumerate by using the intruder function in burpsuite.

Like usual, I URL decode the link and try to see if the default thing will get me anywhere, and it didn't. (I did URL encode it later)
![[Pasted image 20230201220246.png]]

I can try and guess 192.168.0.2 and 3, 4 5 and so on but that is a lengthy process that I want to automate. This is where the intruder comes in (ctrl + I).

In this case I changed nothing in the "target" tab. I press "clear positions" and then "add position" on the 1. 
![[Pasted image 20230201220812.png]]

Now the payload tab:
![[Pasted image 20230201220906.png]]
Everything I did here is self explanatory, I picked numbers starting from 1 to 255 incrementing by 1 (since why would I skip any). 

Now I start the attack. The first time when it did work, I forgot to take a screenshot. In order for it to work the second time, I got rid of the forward slash after "8080" which SEEMED to be the deciding factor. 
The exact payload is: http://192.168.0.ยง1ยง:8080

The majority of the IP links will get a generic server error (500). What I'm looking for is a 404 not found error, which means that the server is up, but the default port 8080 isn't running anything. 

![[Pasted image 20230201224214.png]]
182 is the one.

![[Pasted image 20230201224417.png]]

Now I do the same thing and search for carlos in the raw code and copy the correct second end of the payload link. Once again I need to follow redireciton and I won't be able to see if It worked before I'm no longer in the admin panel. 

![[Pasted image 20230201224630.png]]

This is the end of the lab.

### 3. Against blacklist-based input filters
https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter

Similar to the previous labs, I need to access the admin panel and delete the user carlos with the vulnerable point of entry being the stock check feature. 
![[Pasted image 20230222102211.png]]

The techniques used in the previous lab won't work this time: http://localhost , http://127.0.0.1 , net:8080/ 

the word "admin" will also be blacklisted. 

The localhost IP can be represented in other forms, such as:
```
127.1
2130706433 (decimal form)
017700000001 (octal)
```
Once again the vulnerable site is the stock check feature.
Trying http://127.0.0.1 won't work, it will respond with: 
![[Pasted image 20230309105837.png]]
Trying the IP in decimal and octal form won't work either.
However: 
![[Pasted image 20230309110130.png]]

Then proceeding to go to http://127.1/admin won't work, becuase the string 'admin' will be blacklisted with a regex search

URL-encoding a letter in 'admin' won't work either, because there is one layer of url-decoding. 

To double URL-encode, highlight what is needed and right click to go to the 'convert selection' section. Then go to URL and then 'URL encode all characters'. 

![[Pasted image 20230309111041.png]]

Once again the admin panel is visible and all I have to do now is search for carlos on on the source code, paste the rest of the file path and send again. I will be opted out of the admin panel once this happens.

### 4. Bypassing whitelist-based input filters
https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-whitelist-filter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJhxTN0T_UM

Starting off using the most basic technique, this will be the error response:
![[Pasted image 20230309131825.png]]

Given this information, I don't even need to try any of the IP variants since the host name is filtered to only allow stock.weliketosohp.net 

Most applications would allow for user credentials to be added before the "@" like such:
```
https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host
```
![[Pasted image 20230309164356.png]]
This didn't work, however the error message changed and it does not compain about the host. 

![[Pasted image 20230309113009.png]]

### 5. Filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability
