This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server that is running the application. Often times the other parts of the hosting infrastruture can be compromised. This allows for further pivoting.

### 1. simple case
https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-simple

![[Pasted image 20230307130731.png]]

After going to the stock check function, a post request on the HTTP history tab will show up. 
![[Pasted image 20230307130115.png]]

Access this POST request and send it to the repeater.
![[Pasted image 20230307130240.png]]
(In a real penetration test, both parameters would be tested for this vulnerability)

To test for the vulnerability, something as simple as using echo {string} can be used:
```
productId=3 & echo aksjnefkjn &
```

The productId is changed from 3 to:
```
3= & whoami &
```
Then URL-encoded. 
The '&' character is a shell command seperator, thus making the OS execute 3 seperate commands.

### 2. detecting blind OS command injection with time delays
https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-time-delays
| command purpose       | Linux       | Windows       |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| name of current user  | whoami      | whoami        |
| operating system      | uname -a    | ver           |
| network configuration | ifconfig    | ipconfig /all |
| network connections   | netstat -an | netstat -an   |
| running processes     | ps -ef      | tasklist      |                      |             |               |

Many instances of OS command injection vulnerabilities are blind, meaning that the output of the command is not returned within the HTTP response.

This can be detected used time delays, which allows me to detect the vulnerability using rather the absense of an output. 

The command:
```
ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 
```
will ping the localhost IP's loopback network adapter for 10 seconds, and all I have to do is simply count as soon as I send it through the repeater. 

I send an arbitrary feedback submission:
![[Pasted image 20230307134558.png]]

This POST request is shown in the HTTP history tab, then send to the repeater. The 'email' parameter is the vulnerable site:
![[Pasted image 20230307134733.png]]
It took exactly 10 seconds for the response to show, thus the vulnerability has been detected. 

### 3. blind OS command injection with output redirection 
https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-output-redirection

![[Pasted image 20230307140113.png]]
Starting off with an arbitrary feedback submission. This POST request is then sent to the repeater for me to detect the vulnerability. 

Then to detect the vulnerability, need to use the sleep command. In this case it was the email parameter.
```
email=a%40gmail.com&
email=a%40gmail.com & sleep 10 #&
email=a%40gmail.com+%26+sleep+10+%23&
```
The hashtag comments out all that comes after it

![[Pasted image 20230321132842.png]]

Now I have to redirect the whoami command to a writeable file which was given: /var/www/images 
```
email=a%40gmail.com & whoami > /var/www/images/randomname.txt #&
email=a%40gmail.com+%26+whoami+>+/var/www/images/randomname.txt+%23&
```
![[Pasted image 20230321133607.png]]

To access this new "randomname.txt", I can change the parameter for one of the several image GET  requests on the home page. To access these on HTTP history, the filter for images must be turned on and intercept must be off.
![[Pasted image 20230321133834.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230321133900.png]]

Then I click on a random one, send it to the repeater and change it into randomname.txt
![[Pasted image 20230321134012.png]]

End of lab.

### 4. blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction

I can't do this one because I don't have access to burp collaborator subdomains. It is only on the professional version. 

### 5. ways of injecting OS commands
