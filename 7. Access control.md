WIthin the web application context, access control regards to privilege escalation of website structures. They are mainly dependant on:
- authentication: identification and confirmation of users and associated permission.
- session management: matching of subsequent HTTP requests with the right user. 

Access controls can be classified into 3 categories:
- vertical access control: mechanisms that restrict access to sensitive functionally that is unavailable to low privilege users.
- horizontal access control: mechanisms that grand/restrict access to certain resources to user.
- context dependant access control: restrict access to functionality and resources based on the application's state (e.g. prevention of performing actions in the wrong order).

### 1. Unprotected functionality 
https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality
**Unprotected admin functionality**

In this lab, /admin returned a not found error. However trying /robots.txt returned this:
![[Pasted image 20230404115458.png]]
Despite saying "disallow", the page had disclosed the admin panel and I now know it is:
```
/administrator-panel
```

I type that in instead and delete the user carlos.

**Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL**

This lab uses a simple and unaffective way to obfuscate the admin panel in a "security by obscurity" approach. Simply use inspect element and ctrl + F the word "admin".

Now I navigate to this link and then ctrl + F (carlos) to find the link that leads to deleting the user.

### 2. Parameter-based access control methods
Some applications determine and store the user's access rights upon login and store this information in a user-controllable location such as cookies, hidden fields or preset query string parameters. 

Access control decisions are based on vulnerable sites such as:
	https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true
	https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?role=1

Users can simply modify these values to gain access to functionality that would otherwise by unauthorized. 

https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-controlled-by-request-parameter
**User role controlled by request parameter**

A set of login credentials (wiener:peter) were given and I am instructed to access the admin panel to delete the user carlos. 

The cookies are accessible only after a successful login, hence that is why I am given credentials.

This is what the proxy intercepts when I type in the credentials:
![[Pasted image 20230405111926.png]]
(If I do this lab and keep going back and forth on the website, sometimes the cookies line will already show up roughlt near where I drew red squiggles. Do not change Admin to be true and just log in normally.)

I forward it until I get to this GET request:
![[Pasted image 20230405112145.png]]

I send it to the repeater and modify the payload. Instead of GET /my-account, I change it to GET /admin and make Admin = true
![[Pasted image 20230405112600.png]]

Now I simply ctrl + F carlos, find the corect link and change the GET request parameter to this. To see if it indeed was performed, I have to go back to /admin.
![[Pasted image 20230405112822.png]]

Videos of this lab showed different solutions that all boil down to the same thing. Some didn't use repeater at all and others had to change the Admin parameter to be true in 2 consecutive payloads. 

https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-can-be-modified-in-user-profile
**user role can be modified in user profile**

For a user to access the admin panel, the userid must be 2, this can be modified by the user. Once again I'm given the credential (wiener:peter) to log in. 

![[Pasted image 20230406085303.png]]

If I use the update email function and change it to some arbitrary email, observe what the response is if I send this via the repeater. 

![[Pasted image 20230406085557.png]]

I can simply append into the JSON:
```
"roleid":2
```
and change the GET request parameter to /admin
![[Pasted image 20230406173338.png]]

Now I search for carlos in the source code and do the same thing as the previous lab. 
```
POST /admin/delete?username=carlos
```
Then I have to go back to /admin if I want to see if it worked. However the lab does congratulate me for completing the lab already. 

### 3. Broken access control resulting from platform misconfiguration
https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-url-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented
**URL-based access control can be circumvented**

Some applications will enforce access control on the platform layer by restricting certain URLs and subsequent methods according to user role, for example:
```ad-example
DENY: POST, /admin/deleteUser, managers
```

Non-standard HTTP headers such as X-Original-URL and X-Rewrite-URL can **override** the URL in the original original request if the application framework supports it. A non-standard request header might by able to circumvent rigorous front-end restriction controls. 

These alternate HTTP headers are similar in fashion concepts like: IP obfuscation in [[9. Server side request forgery]] with alternate representations, 

In this lab, I am required to access the unauthenticated admin panel and delete the user carlos. 

I add /admin to the base URL and send it to the repeater. It is no surprise that I get an error from it. However when I modify the payload:
```ad-todo
/admin --> /
<X-Original-URL: login>
```
![[Pasted image 20230411101438.png]]

This indicates that the alternate HTTP header had been processed over the request URL. Now I will change it to:
```ad-todo 
X-Original-URL: /admin
```

![[Pasted image 20230411101836.png]]

I am now in the admin panel. In order to delete carlos, I first search for the URL in the source code:
```
/admin/delete/?username=carlos
```

I will put in /admin/delete in the X-Original-URL path and ?username=carlos in the real query  string. 
![[Pasted image 20230411102117.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230411102458.png]]

This works but I don't understand why. If I modify the payload in the proxy to get me to the admin panel, my access to delete the users is denied.

### 4. Broken access control resulting from URL-matching discrepancies
